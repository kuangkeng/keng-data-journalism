headline: "Taft Union High School, Taft, CA",
text: "Jan 10, 2013 â€“ A 16-year-old student in Southern California set out to shoot two other students who had bullied him. The unnamed student came armed to Taft Union High School with a 12-gauge shotgun early January. One student was shot in the chest and sustained non-life-threatening injuries while the second target was shot at but got away unscathed. A year earlier, the shooter was suspended for compiling a "hit list". Many students described the shooter as a loner who was called names. If it were not for science teacher Ryan Heber, 41, who talked the young shooter into putting the gun down, more students may have been harmed."

text: "Mar 18, 2013 â€“ The University of Central Florida had a "close call" with a student gunman on its campus March of last year. Police reported, James Oliver Seevakumaran, 30, made a checklist to execute a mass murder that included instructions like "pull fire alarm" and "give them hell". Seevakumaran pulled the fire alarm in his dormitory with the hopes of causing panic and having all the students gather in the halls. His roommate, Arabo Babkhani, said the quiet gunman never made eye-contact with him until the day of the event where Seevakumaran held a gun to Babkhani's face. Babkhani immediately locked himself in the bathroom to call police. When police arrived they found that Seevakumaran had shot himself along with a .45-caliber semi-automatic pistol, a .22-caliber tactical rifle, ammunition and a backpack with four homemade explosive devices."

Last June, John Zawahri, a former student of the SMC, shot and killed five, and injured several. The spree of violence began just before noon at the gunman's home, where the 23-year-old killed his own father and brother, and lit the familyâ€™s house ablaze. Zawahri then hi-jacked a nearby car, and demanded the driver, an adult woman, take him to Santa Monica College. Along the way, he opened fire on another woman driving by and also a city bus. The woman and three bus passengers were injured. As the shooter approached the campus, he fired at Carlos Navarro Franco, a groundskeeper at the school, who died instantly. Franco's passenger, daughter Marcela, was rushed to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in West Los Angeles, where she passed away a day later. En route to the school's library entrance, Zawahri gunned down an unidentified adult woman in her 50s. When entering the library, the shooter fired over 70 rounds of gun shots, There, he was shot and killed by police."

Prior to surrendering, Hill told bookkeeper Antoinette Tuff, that he was mentally unstable, and had nothing to live for. Hill was charged with aggravated assault on a police officer, terroristic threats, and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. The gunmanâ€™s brother, Tim, considered Michael a dangerous individual, telling NBC News that his brother â€œwas bipolar and suffered from ADD.â€ Hill was questioned by police for hours, but his motive remained unclear. Officials are also unsure whether or not Hill had ties to the school. No one was injured. In December 2013, Hill was classified as mentally unable to stand trial, and entered a plea of mental incompetence."

What they didn't think was that the boy had their Ruger 9mm pistol tucked away in his backpack.<br><br>The 12-year-old student arrived on the grounds of Sparks Middle School, armed and dangerous. Shortly before 7:15AM, the boy shot a student in the shoulder, wounding him. He then continued toward the basketball court, where he shot and killed Michael Landsberry, a math teacher at the school.

Arapahoe County Sheriff Grayson Robinson said, â€œthere is no question that this was a very deliberate and planned eventâ€ He also said the teen was likely motivated by a dispute with his debate coach, Tracy Murphy. Murphy was believed to be the gunman's intended target.<br><br>Upon arrival at the school, Pierson entered through a door that was normally locked. He fired his first shot randomly in the schoolâ€™s hallway, then his second, killing 17-year-old Claire Esther Davis of the senior class. He fired another blow before entering the schoolâ€™s library and media center. According to Robinson, Pierson fired a third shot in the area outside the office of the school librarian and Murphy. He then ignited a Molotov cocktail in the center of the library, causing a destructive fire. With his fifth and final shot, he took his own life, shooting himself in the head."
