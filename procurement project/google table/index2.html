    <h1>Here are the top 100 winners of open-tender government contracts</h1>
    
    <p class="intro">In a first-of-its-kind analysis on the public record of Malaysian federal government procurements believed to be made from year 2005 to early 2014, it was found that the top 100 companies that received the highest value of contracts given through open tender, dominated 38 percent of the total contract value.<p>

    There were a total of 8,886 open-tender contracts published on MyProcurement, the government procurement website, until Mac 6, 2014, the day when the data used for this report was collected.<p>

    The total value for these 8,886 contracts is RM32 billion, and 38 percent or RM12.22 billion of them were given to the 100 companies although they make up merely 2.38 percent of the 4,203 companies that had received contracts published in the website.<p>

    In term of value, the top 100 companies received an average of RM122.23 million worth of contracts, compared to the average value of RM7.21 million received by all 4,203 companies, despite about half of them just won one contract. This indicates the contracts given to these big players were those of high value.<p>

    On top of the list is Primabumi Sdn Bhd, a drug supplier that secured RM876,236,864 from a total of 202 contracts mostly given by the Health Ministry and the Higher Education Ministry.<p>

    <h2>Where have the RM1.7 billion contracts gone?</h2>

    The website launched in 2010 as part of the Government Transformation Programme (GTP) was found to contain numerous errors including incomplete details and typos.<p>

    A total of 276 contracts or 5.32 percent of the total contracts gave no information about the companies that secured them. These 'missing contracts' worth RM1.7 billion in total.<p>

    The worst part is the absence of date for all contracts. One can only guess the dates of some contracts of which the dates were indicated in their tender numbers. From the tender numbers, a small number of contracts were believed to be issued as early as 2005. We believed the published list was not a complete list of open-tender contracts as the total number of contracts – 8,886 - is way too small for a government.<p>

    <h2>Data cleaning</h2>

    In order to conduct accurate analysis, all descriptions of “Sdn Bhd” (private limited) and “Syarikat” (company) in company names were removed as they were spelled in different ways; e.g. “Sdn. Bhd.”, “Sendirian Berhad”, or “Sykt”, “Syk”, “Sykt.”.<p>

    Best attempts were also made to correct typos when company names were spelled differently in different entries by matching their registration numbers. However many companies did not have their registration numbers keyed in or the registration numbers themselves were wrong, making the whole process of data cleaning difficult and tedious.<p>

    Names of the various government agencies have also been consolidated by merging agencies into the ministries they belong to, and standardizing agency names which have been changed over time; e.g. “Kementerian Pelajaran” and “Kementerian Pendidikan”, “Kementerian Wilayah” and “Kementerian Wilayah Persekutuan dan Kesejahteraan Bandar”.<p>
