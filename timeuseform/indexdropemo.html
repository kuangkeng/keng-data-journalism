<h2>About American Time Use Survey 2013</h2>

<p>The results of from the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/atus.nr0.htm" target="_blank"> American Time Use Survey (ATUS) 2013</a> was released on June 18. The annually released survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is a continuous study about how civilians age 15 and over spend their time. These data include the average amount of time per day in 2013 that individuals worked, did household activities, and engaged in leisure and sports activities.</p>

<p>The survey found that on average employed men (7 hours 58 minutes) worked 53 minutes more than employed women (7 hours 5 minutes) on workday, partly due to women's greater likelihood of working part time. However, among full time workers, men (8 hours 20 minutes) also worked 37 minutes longer than women (7 hours 44 minutes).</p>

<p>Watching TV was the top leisure activity among Americans who watch an average of 2 hours 46 minutes per day or 3 hours 14 minutes on weekend day. Men (2 hours 59 minutes) watched 25 minutes more TV than women (2 hours 34 minutes) per day.</p>

<p>Men were more likely than women to participate in sports, exercise, or recreation on any given day - 21 percent compared with 16 percent. On the days that they participated, men also spent 40 minutes more in these activities than women – 1 hour 54 minutes compared with 1 hour 14 minutes.</p>

<p>Time spent playing games or using a computer for leisure varied greatly by age. Individuals in the age groups of 15 – 19 and 20 – 24, spent 52 and 56 minutes respectively on the activity on weekend day, the highest among all age groups. The average time across all ages was 29 minutes.</p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal has published a <a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/aging-americans-sleep-more-work-less-survey-finds-1403121530" target="_blank">report</a> comparing the survey results with historical data.
