<h2>About American Time Use Survey 2013</h2>

<p>The results of from the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/atus.nr0.htm" target="_blank"> American Time Use Survey (ATUS) 2013</a> was released on June 18. The annually released survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is a continuous study about how civilians age 15 and over spend their time. These data include the average amount of time per day in 2013 that individuals worked, did household activities, and engaged in leisure and sports activities.</p>

<p>The survey found that on average employed men (7.97 hours) worked 53 minutes more than employed women (7.08 hours) on workday, partly due to women's greater likelihood of working part time. However, among full time workers, men (8.34 hours) also worked 37 minutes longer than women (7.73 hours).</p>

<p>Watching TV was the top leisure activity among Americans who watch an average of 2.77 hours per day or 3.24 hours on weekend day. Men (2.98 hours) watched 25 minutes more TV than women (2.57 hours) per day.</p>

<p>Men were more likely than women to participate in sports, exercise, or recreation on any given day - 21 percent compared with 16 percent. On the days that they participated, men also spent 40 minutes more in these activities than women – 1.9 hours compared with 1.24 hours.</p>

<p>Time spent playing games or using a computer for leisure varied greatly by age. Individuals in the age groups of 15 – 19 and 20 – 24, spent 52 and 56 minutes respectively on the activity on weekend day, the highest among all age groups. The average time across all ages was 29 minutes.</p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal has published a <a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/aging-americans-sleep-more-work-less-survey-finds-1403121530" target="_blank">report</a> comparing the survey results with historical data.
