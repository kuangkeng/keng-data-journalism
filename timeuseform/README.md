An interactive quiz
====================
An interactive quiz developed for NBC Local Media to allow users to see how they spend their time compared with American population according to the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) 2014 report. It is built using HTML form and d3 (to draw dynamic charts according to user input).

This project will be published soon.
