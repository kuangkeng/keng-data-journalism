							<div><h3>Shed light into Malaysian government procurement</h3></div>
							
							<div>
								<p class="para">
								The procurement process of Malaysian government has always been marred by favoritism and cronism. Allegations that government officials and politicians manipulate the procurement system to give lucrative contracts to their cronies and allies are often heard.
								<p class="para">
								Since few years ago, the federal government has started to publish the records of all government procurement made through open tender and direct negotiation on its official website. Details include the value and purpose of each contract, as well as the agency that gives the contract and companies that wins the contract. However no Malaysian media has ever examine the online database.
								<p class="para">
								My project would be an analysis and visualization of the database. Among others, I could find out companies that have secured the largest number or highest value of contracts, and the distribution of contracts among companies to see whether they were monopolized by certain companies. The type of visualization largely depends on the findings from the database.
								<p class="para">
								If the project succeed and published by Malaysian media, other journalists could follow up the issue by investigating the background, owners and shareholders of those companies implicated in my project to determine whether they are politically connected.
								<p class="para">
								The procurement records can be found <a href="http://myprocurement.treasury.gov.my/templates/theme427/keputusantender_arkib.php" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://myprocurement.treasury.gov.my/templates/theme427/keputusantender.php" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://myprocurement.treasury.gov.my/index.php/en/list-tender-rundingan-terus" target="_blank">here</a>.
								<p class="para">
								I would like to contact Malaysian treasury officials who are familar with the database to obtain more details related to the database such as how frequent it is updated, and whether it is an exhaustive list.
								<p class="para">
								To execute this project, I need to program a 'robot' to scrap the data on more than 800 webpages and compile them in a spreadsheet for further analysis. Then depending on the findings, I need to decide the best ways and learn the skills to present/visualize my findings.
								<p class="para">
								The final product could be published in <a href="http://www.malaysiakini.com" target="_blank">Malaysiakini</a>, an independent news website that I have served as a journalist for 8 years. It is Malaysia's most visited news website known for its critical reports against the authorities.
