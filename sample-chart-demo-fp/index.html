<h2>1. <a href="http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2014/10/10/hey_swaziland_18_won_t_buy_you_a_solution_to_your_aids_crisis">Hey Swaziland: $18 Won't Buy You a Solution to Your AIDS Crisis</a></h2>
<p>This report tells a controversial policy to address HIV epidemic in Swaziland, an African country that has the world's highest HIV prevalence. Swaziland's King announced that he will use some of the international funds for HIV prevention to pay teenage girls in the country for them to protect their virginity.</p>
<p>The two charts below provide readers with more context about the HIV situation in Swaziland. The first compares Swaziland with other countries with the highest HIV prevalence as wel as the global average. The second shows that young girls in Swaziland are more vulnerable to HIV compared to men.</p>

<h2>2. <a href="http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2014/10/14/aging_population_forces_disaster_planners_to_adapt_strategies">Aging Population Forces Disaster Planners to Adapt Strategies</a></h2>
<p>This story is about how disaster planners change their strategies to address the aging world population. It has two maps that show population in many countries will be older in 2050, however it does not show you how fast.</p>
<p>If we add in the chart below, readers can see the expected increase of the population age over 65.</p>

<h2>3. <a href="http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2014/09/26/and_stay_out_australia_signs_a_deal_to_unload_refugees_onto_cambodia">...And Stay Out! Australia Signs a Deal to Unload Refugees Onto Cambodia</a></h2>
<p>The story tells a controversial agreement between Australia and Cambodia that allows Australia to 'dump' its unwanted refugees to Cambodia. In return, Cambodia will receive development aid from Australia. The story however does not tell much about the context that prompted Australia to do so.</p>
<p>The two charts illustrate the increase number of refugees heading to Australia since 2006, pushing up the death toll. This MAY BE part of the reason why the agreement received majority support in Australia. However, be mindful that data does not always prove causation. Most of the time it shows correlation that warrants further investigation.</p>
