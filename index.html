<h1>Hi this is Keng, how you doin today?</h1>
<p>This is my ugly <a href="map-week-1.html">map</a>. <br>Please bear with me, here is another ugly <a href="child-care-cost-practice/child-care-cost-map.html">MAP</a> on US Childcare Cost.</p>

<h2>Kevin and Amanda, here's my pitch for class project:</h2>
<h3>1. Shed light into Malaysian government procurement</h3>
<p>The procurement process of Malaysian government has always been marred by favoritism and cronism. Allegations that government officials and politicians manipulate the procurement system to give lucrative contracts to their cronies and allies are often heard.<br><br>
Since few years ago, the federal government has started to publish the records of all government procurement made through open tender and direct negotiation on its official website. Details include the value and purpose of each contract, as well as the agency that gives the contract and companies that wins the contract. However no Malaysian media has ever examine the online database.<br><br>
My project would be an analysis and visualization of the database. Among others, I could find out companies that have secured the largest number or highest value of contracts, and the distribution of contracts among companies to see whether they were monopolized by certain companies. The type of visualization largely depends on the findings from the database.<br><br>
If the project succeed and published by Malaysian media, other journalists could follow up the issue by investigating the background, owners and shareholders of those companies implicated in my project to determine whether they are politically connected.<br><br>
The procurement records can be found <a href="http://myprocurement.treasury.gov.my/templates/theme427/keputusantender_arkib.php" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://myprocurement.treasury.gov.my/templates/theme427/keputusantender.php" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://myprocurement.treasury.gov.my/index.php/en/list-tender-rundingan-terus" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br>
I would like to contact Malaysian treasury officials who are familar with the database to obtain more details related to the database such as how frequent it is updated, and whether it is an exhaustive list.<br><br>
To execute this project, I need to program a 'robot' to scrap the data on more than 800 webpages and compile them in a spreadsheet for further analysis. Then depending on the findings, I need to decide the best ways and learn the skills to present/visualize my findings.<br><br>
The final product could be published in <a href="http://www.malaysiakini.com" target="_blank">Malaysiakini</a>, an independent news website that I have served as a journalist for 8 years. It is Malaysia's most visited news website known for its critical reports against the authorities.</p><br><br>
<h3>2. Interactive website to illustrate gerrymandering in Malaysian election system</h3>
<p>In the 2013 Malaysian general election, the opposition won 51% of the popular vote but the figure only translated to 40% of the total parliamentary seats (89 out of 222) while the ruling coalition continued to form the next federal government by winning 60% of the parliamentary seats (133 out of 222) although it only secured 47% of the popular votes.<br><br>
As a result, the ruling coalition, which has been in the power since independence in 1957, is effectively a minority government. This awkward situation is caused by the disproportionate distribution of voters and over-representation of rural constituencies, which are traditional stronghold of the ruling coalition. For example, the parliamentary constituency of Putrajaya, the country's administration district, has 15,791 voters while Serdand,an urban constituency won by the opposition, has 133,139 voters. Both constituencies elect only one Member of Parliament respectively. The next round of voting constituency delimitation will be carried out this year, providing an opportunity to correct the unbalanced voters distribution and create a fairer election system. However public awareness and pressure are critical to force the Election Commission, which has been biased towards the ruling coalition, to carry out an transparent and fair demilitation.<br><br>
Hence I would like to create an interactive visualization that illustrates the malapportionment, and allows Malaysian voters to compare the weight carried by their votes against others'. The viz could be a bubble chart (since there are 222 seats, a big number) or an animated cartograms. A voter could insert their ID number to find his/her voting constituency and select another constituency to compare the vote weight of both constituencies.<br><br>
The electoral data required for this project is available publicly and I can obtain a digital copy of it easily.<br><br>
I need to figure out what are the best ways to visualize the malapportionment and learn programming language (maybe Javascript?) to construct an interactive website that allows users to insert information and then pulls out corresponding information from the Election Commission's official website.<br><br>
I need to talk to several academics who study Malaysian electoral system to gain insights and different views on the subject.<br><br>
I'm confident that should the project succeed, my former employer Malaysiakini would be able to publish it.</p>
